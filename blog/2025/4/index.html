                The blog also now has post format sections which came from the contact form viewing page. 
                As the <a target="_blank" href="/index.html">front page</a> says, Christmas is now in 11 days!!! I can't wait!

                I was at the Las Vegas strip for the past two days. 
                It was fun, but every single first floor of any building I visited there had a casino and the hotel layout forced you to walk through it. 
                I went on the big wheel (ferris wheel) and the Las Vegas Monorail. 
                The Las Vegas sphere was interesting even though I never went there. 
                Some of the shops were cool like the chocolate one with so much different merchandise and special versions of popular chocolates that I had never seen before. 
                The food wasn't that good though and it was expensive.

                I've been at death valley for the past three days (11/25, 11/26, 11/27). 
                It was fun. 
                I went to Las Vegas in the evening (18:00). 
                The destination is "Las Vegas Strip". 
                I saw the sunset on a mountain above the salt flats. 
                That was fun considering that the salt flats have been flooded. 
                There has been practically no wifi or cellular signals in the national park. 
                The only entertainment I got between places was music, scenery, and my coding editor.

                This latest update to the website should be a stable update instead of a work-in-progress. 
                Tommorrow I'll be traveling to Death Valley. 
                It should be fun.

                I finished some final parts of the cookie page.

                Today was a day when I had more free time than usual. 
                I played with my raspberry pi and tried out Lynx web browser. 
                It was created in 1992 and it can only support html. 
                It works in the terminal. 
                I'll try to add some javascript features to this website soon, but knowing me, they'll probably be added a week to a month later. 
                Next week will be hard. 
                I have a quiz in first period English on monday, a math test on tuesday, a hard math assignment in class on thursday, two English projects due on friday, and a science test on friday. 
                At least I'll have a week-long Thanksgiving break on the week after that busy week. 
                Cookies for this website to allow users to have a choice to be tracked or to not will be added soon. 
                After I learn javascript, I'll try to learn backend server coding to add a comments section and/or a feedback form. 
                Dark/Light mode was completed today. 
                It should work to store the mode on the computer until you clear the cache. 
                Tommorrow I will add the feature to a page or possibly just on the footer. 
                It was created on the test page.

                Today is the start of the 4 day weekend! &#127881; 
                I will have a lot of time to do whatever I want. 
                I'll be working on this website alot and maybe possible going to code some scratch projects. 
                My main objective of this long weekend is to have fun and learn javascript. 
                I am currently taking a w3schools javascript course to learn the basics of javascript. 
                The website icon needs some improvement, so I might work on that too. 
                Also, I use VS code to code this and it has AI suggestions and it always tries to help me with everything. 
                It helps me write the blog and also autocomplete some repetitive code. 
                Don't be afraid that this is all written by AI, because I always go back and edit the text or code that it suggests. 
                It is actually very annoying sometimes.

                Today I added a feature on my website to include a different view for dark mode so that it is easier to view in the dark. 
                If your system is set to dark mode, the website should automatically switch to dark mode. 
                I also added a javascript file thing so that I can add all the features I want with it easily. 
                You can see what I'm currently working on by looking at the <a href="/about.html">about page</a>.
                Because of the new changes in styling the color and other things, I will need to do some more work to make sure everything looks the best I can make it look. 
                If you haven't yet noticed, I update this website every time I make a blog post.

                I updated my website to include a footer. 
                I also received course selection information for 9th grade. 
                I think that I've decided on what classes to take next year.

                I got a email today about the next week. Next week is spirit week, so each day has a theme.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Monday: Pajama Day</li>
                <li>Tuesday: Twin Day</li>
                <li>Wednesday: Anything but a Backpack</li>
                <li>Thursday: Wear Red Day</li>
                <li>Friday: Halloween Costumes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The email also said that the 2nd 6-week grading period ends on Friday. 
                The school year is going by fast... 
                Its almost november, but it feels like just yesterday was the start of september. 
                I've been having fun with my 2006 music/video/radio player that includes a caculator and a drawing app. 
                I've researched the flac format and other lossless audio formats, and I've started to try to download some songs to listen on the playere. 
                I also went onto pixilart to make the icons for both the blog and the main website. 
                Some people I used to know in elementary school seem to still be making art on there. 
                My elementary school classmates: If you are reading this, please send me a email at the email linked on the <a href="/contact.html">contact page</a>.
                I've made 2+ friends at my new school and I look forward to making more. 
                Sorry if my posts are way too lengthy on mobile. 
                I'll be attempting to make the code better for mobile viewing.

                I decided to work on my website a ton. 
                I added a blog section instead of some weird personal and school section where I post. 
                I decided that I might not post too much but not too little, so I sorted the blogs into quarters.
                More ways to contact me have been added on the contact page so its easier to reach me.
                I have a lot of stuff to do...
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Chinese homework: wednesday/sunday</li>
                <li>School homework: averaging at ~3 pages/day</li>
                <li>Website updating</li>

            <p>Schools been fine so far. 
                My mom's enrolled me into one after school chinese class on wednesday, a chinese class on saturday, and a python class on saturday. 
                I go to school clubs to have fun during lunch and whenever there aren't any that I like, I go to the library to do random stuff on my computer. 
                I've also found out that there are alot of game sites on the internet that the school hasn't blocked. 
                The main one I use is <a href="https://mathactivities.github.io" target="_blank">Math Activites</a>. 
                Specifically for Math Activities, you have to go the footer and click on the invisible link below "Contact." 
                Since I already listed one of the games, why not list all of them. Some of these might be blocked so don't count on them all working.
